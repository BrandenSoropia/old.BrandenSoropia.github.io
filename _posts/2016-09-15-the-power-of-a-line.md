##The Power of a Line

A line on paper. A line of code. What do they both have in common? A line all by itself isn't very great, but when you make more they become a sketch, an app or even a blog post. Isn't it amazing how these simple lines connect and create something that didn't exist before? I want to show you how powerful a single line can be and where it can take you.

It's a place where we all start. I recently began practicing drawing lines, to form boxes

But they will suck. Your hands shake and you end up with weird curves, you hack your way through a problem and leave a blood mess of illegible code, your sentences don't connect; all of this sucks. And that'll make you feel bad. But you are learning. You can always make it better. A friend always tells me this, "Fail faster", and no matter how much I resist accepting it, those words have rung true each  You know where the mistake is and all it takes is a little erasing or a few backspaces here and there.
